<p>
Here is a sampling of past work and personal projects that I've worked on along with the primary languages used for them.

<div id="projects">
<H2>Smart Categories [Java]</H2>
<p>
I worked on the back end of the initial version of Smart Categories at Amazon. Smart Categories suggests browsenodes (or categories) for a given search term.
</p>
<p>
To see it in action you can look at the left hand side of <a href="http://www.amazon.com">a search for hello kitty on amazon.com</a>
</p>
<H2>miss-categorization detection [Perl prototype , C/C++]</H2>
<p>
Detects miss-classified items in the catalog. No example available.
</p>
<H2>web2.0collage [j.s. & plt-scheme & perl]</H2>
<p>
Designed with the idea of illustrating the privacy concerns of the CSS link colouring bug/feature it created a collage of websites the user had visited from its set.

<H2>Pigs Can Fly Site Monitor for the Android ["Java"]</H2>
<p>
A simple site monitor written for the Android. It checked at a configurable interval to see if a site was up. The purpose was to learn my way around the Android SDK more than anything else.

<H2>Device Scape port to Open Moko [library only] {C}</H2>
<p>DeviceScape allows people that have WiFi credientals to automatically sign on to things like StarBucks, Boingo, etc. I ported the library and CLI to the OpenMoko.
</p>

<H2>f.b. wishlist application [php]</H2>
<p>
Provide basic wishlist functionality through Amazon wishlist API and integrated into the FaceBook platform. We only ever got a few users for it though and once my VPS at the time died we decided not to bring it back online.
</p>
<H2>All The Code [Ruby on Rails, OCAML, Perl, C, Java]</H2>
<p>
All The Code was a fairly cool source code search engine (of course I am biased, being its creator). The frontend was done with Ruby on Rials, the back end work was done with a mixture of perl and OCAML along with a bit of Java test code thrown in for good measure. A tiny bit of the parsing was done in C with flex & bison, but most of it was one in OCAML. All The Code treated function calls/library includes similar to how regular search engines treat links, the hope was to return the most relevant library in this fashion. I tried to see if I could find any companies willing to use it internally, but was unable to move beyond a few beta testers. There was a free publicly available version that indexed Java. It got written up on slashdot:

<H2>SVN bindings for mzscheme [scheme, c, swig, perl]</H2>
<p>
I created bindings for SVN in mzscheme. Nothing too complicated, but it got me access to the main SVN repo which I'm proud of.

<H2>Real Time / CS452 [C]</H2>
<p>
Along with a friend, we wrote an operating system for pair of x86 boxes that controlled some trains. A lot of long nights, a lot of cursing at intel, but also a lot of fun.
</p>
<H2>Kernel stuff [C]</H2>
<P>
I worked on some ISLSM driver code, however that driver has since fallen by the wayside [I lost access to the card and it looks like the other contributors also drifted away] ( http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-closed@lists.debian.org/msg125896.html ). I also did a bunch of forward porting of device drivers @ Xandros. I have an inconsequential amount of code in the kernel to report signal strength for atmel wireless cards.
